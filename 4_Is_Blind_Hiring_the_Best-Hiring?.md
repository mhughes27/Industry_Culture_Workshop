I do not believe that blind hiring is the best approach to addressing the biases in the tech industry.  I believe that elements of blind hiring can be used effectively early in the hiring process.  The blind process can produce a deep pool of qualified candidates.  After the pool has been established, then the anonymity must disappear.  The employer and the potential employee need to get to know each other and make sure it is a good fit.  I do not feel that it is fair to the person doing the hiring, to go at it totally blind.  Likewise the future employee needs to be able to fit into the work place effectively.  

I do favor this approach of blind hiring to that of a diversity-first approach.  I do not believe that hiring someone just to fill a quota does anybody any good.  I feel that a job should always go to the most qualified candidate that will be the best fit for the company.  I do think that policies like the NFL's Rooney Rule to combat racial discrepancies are more effective.  Before a team hires a new head coach, they must interview at least one minority candidate.  It sometimes happens that the minority candidate has a successful interview and is hired, but if not they at least get the interviewing experience and exposure.
