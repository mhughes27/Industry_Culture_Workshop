This article articulates the struggle that occurs in nearly every workplace.  The boss/subordinate relationship is often times a tricky one.  There are many forces at play and as the article states, a relationship that sours is usually the result of something minor that snow-balls into something more.  Being an effective boss is not easy, but neither is being a loyal subordinate. 

The example of Jeff and Steve shows that communication is the key to have a good partnership.  I do not think that anyone meant for this to happen.  Neither set the the other up for failure - it is just something that happens.  Without being there, it is impossible to say who is more at fault in this situation.  I also do not think that it is about assigning blame.  There is always enough blame to go around and it solves nothing.  In this situation, communication needed to improve in order resolve the conflict and since it did not - someone needed to move on with the hope that both parties learned from their experiences.  

If Jeff would have articulated his motives, Steve would have been less likely to feel the way that he did.  Jeff wanted to learn more about what Steve does on a daily basis and wanted to show to his boss that he could handle the new job.  If that information was on the table for the beginning, then things would not have turned out the way they did.  

With that being said, I do not feel that Steve handled things appropriately.  Steve essentially shut down.  He failed to give his best effort which led to more micromanaging, which led to more frustrations.  And the syndrome completed its cycle.
